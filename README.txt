# CPSC 304 project

Our create table (SQL DDL) statements are found in the main-oracle.php file instead of in an SQL file.
This is to be done so we could make a reset tables button on the page. Therefore, we have decided to compile
the create table statements into a sql file despite already having it in the php file. Thus, we have one sql file
that is a compilation of the insertion statements and create table statements used and is created specifically
for submission called submission.sql .
